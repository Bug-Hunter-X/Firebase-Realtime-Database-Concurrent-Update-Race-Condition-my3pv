The issue stems from an unusual interaction between Firebase's Realtime Database and the way data updates are handled within a specific asynchronous operation.  When attempting to update a value based on its current state (e.g., incrementing a counter), a race condition might arise. This occurs if multiple clients concurrently try to read and update the same data, leading to incorrect final values.  The problem isn't immediately apparent in simple testing scenarios but emerges under higher load or with concurrent requests.

```javascript
// buggy code
firebase.database().ref('counter').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  let currentCount = snapshot.val() || 0;
  firebase.database().ref('counter').set(currentCount + 1);
});
```
