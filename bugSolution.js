The solution involves using Firebase's transaction functionality to ensure atomic updates.  Transactions guarantee that the read and write operations happen as a single unit, preventing race conditions.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// corrected code
firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(currentCount => {
  if (currentCount === null) {
    return 1;
  }
  return currentCount + 1;
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Counter updated atomically');
});
```

This approach ensures that even with multiple concurrent requests, the counter is accurately incremented. The transaction function handles the read, modification, and write operations atomically, eliminating any possibility of data inconsistencies.
